\subsection{Design of our SSTF algorithm}
We used started with the basic outline of a block driver from this website: http://blog.superpat.com/2010/05/04/a-simple-block-driver-for-linux-kernel-2-6-31/. From there, we added the encryption in the sbd_tranfer function. We used aes cipher for the encryption.

\section{Follow-Up Questions}
\subsection{Main point of the assignment}
The main point of this assignment was for us to learn how to take a poorly documented API and using the resources available, get an outdated piece of code to work. 
\subsection{Approach to the Problem}
We approached the problem by using this book https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/ as a big source. It told us how to load modules into the vm and how to modify the makefile and Kconfig files. 
\subsection{Testing}
We tested by using a lot of printk statements that printed out the encrypted and decrypted I/O. 
\subsection{What we Learned}
We learned that having poorly documented APIs are hard to work with and that it takes a lot of research to get them to work correctly.
